# Issue Resolution: Blank Page Problem

## Root Cause Identified
The blank page issue was caused by TypeScript compilation errors in the AI module files, which prevented the entire application from building properly.

## What Was Happening
1. When AI modules were implemented, they contained type mismatches and import errors
2. TypeScript tries to compile ALL files in the project, not just the ones being used
3. Even though the main application didn't directly import the broken AI files, the build failed
4. This caused the dev server to serve an empty/broken JavaScript bundle
5. Result: Blank page in the browser

## Key Files That Caused Issues
- `src/ai/*.ts` - Various TypeScript and import errors
- `src/hooks/useAI.tsx` - Type mismatches with mock service
- `src/components/AIInsightsPanel.tsx` - Importing broken AI types
- `src/types.ts` - Re-exporting broken AI types

## Solution Steps Taken
1. **Isolation**: Moved all AI-related files to backup locations
2. **Verification**: Confirmed minimal app works without AI code
3. **Build Test**: Verified that removal of AI code allows successful build
4. **Type Cleanup**: Commented out AI type exports

## Status
âœ… **Blank page issue RESOLVED**
- App now loads and displays correctly
- TypeScript builds successfully
- Dev server runs without errors

## Next Steps
1. Reimplement AI functionality with proper TypeScript types
2. Ensure all AI imports are browser-compatible
3. Add proper error boundaries for AI features
4. Test incrementally to avoid regression

## Key Learnings
- TypeScript compiles entire project, not just used files
- Import/export errors can break entire build
- Always test builds after adding new modules
- Use incremental development for complex features
